		<h1>SAM-1&trade; Use</h1>

		<h2>Connect SAM-1&trade;</h2>

<p>To use the Sensorex SAM-1&trade; meter, attach the module to the headphone jack of your Apple or Android device. Then connect a Sensorex Smart Sensor such as the Sensorex S2000C to the Smart connector on the bottom of the SAM-1&trade;(opposite of the cable and audio connector).</p>
<p>Remove the supplied soaker bottle or soaker cap that keeps the sensing surfaces wet, but consider saving for future storage of the sensor</p>

<p>To verify accuracy of reading, follow calibration guide in the information section.</p>
<h2>Taking measurements</h2>
<p>To take a reading, dip the sensor into the solution to be measured. The display will show the measurement value, which will stabilize over time.</p>

<h2>Recording readings</h2>

<p>Tap the record measurement icon <span class="bold">(&quot;+&quot;)</span> at the top of the display to take a recording of the measured value. This will let you save the reading to the history database. If your device is &quot;location aware&quot;, the coordinates where the reading was taken will be stored with it. The air and solution temperatures are also recorded.</p>
<p>When recording a reading, you have the option to add a site
 location.&nbsp; Site tags are used to group readings together for
        history displays. You can use any descriptive text for the site name.</p>
<p>There are optional fields available when entering readings: Comments and User. These fields can be used to take general notes, information
 about the sensor being used, and details of the person taking the
 measurements.</p>
<p>Recorded readings can be emailed through from the history screen<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>.
 You can select individual or multiple readings.</p>
<h2>Temperature</h2>
<p>The activity of the H<span class="supr">+</span> ions and Conductivity varies with temperature, since pH and Conductivity are temperature sensitive parameters, temperature readings are used to correct the
 value. &nbsp;Solution compensation for temperature must be made if
 highly accurate readings are required for applications with fluctuating temperatures. </p>
<p>The user has three options for temperature compensation, Manual, Air or Sensor.&nbsp; Select Settings in the upper right-hand corner of the display to select which value will be used for correction, and the units to use for display.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Manual" temperature allows the user to manually input a value or use the default of 25&deg;C when the sensor being used does not have a
 integrated temperature sensor.</li>

<li>"Air" temperature uses a built in sensor within the SAM-1&trade; module and is available only when using a non-temperature compensated
 sensor.</li>
<li>"Sensor" is automatically selected when the sensor has a built-in temperature sensor to provide the solution temperature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Solution temperature compensation is accomplished via the smart connector.&nbsp; The <a href="http://smartaquameter.com/s2900c-sam.html" title="S2900C/SAM 3-in 1 pH Sensor with ATC">S2900C</a> is a 3-in-1 pH
 sensor that is ideal for compensating via solution temperature.</p>
