<h1>SAM-1&trade; Sensors</h1>
<p>ORP (REDOX), pH and Conductivity sensors have a limited lifespan. To
 get the most out of your sensors, these procedures can help.</p>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>Always store your ORP (REDOX) and pH sensor with the glass bulb in an
 appropriate solution. Sensorex provides our 
<a title="Sensorex S016 pH Sensor storage solution" href="http://smartaquameter.com/ph-orp-buffers/s016.html">S016 pH
 sensor storage solution</a> in a soaker bottle with new sensors. The pH sensors should never be allowed to dry out. If you do not have a storage solution available, 
<a title="pH 4.01 Buffer Solution" href="http://smartaquameter.com/ph-orp-buffers/b104.html">pH
 4.0 buffer</a> can be used. Never store the sensor in de-ionized or distilled water.&nbsp; Your conductivity sensor should be rinsed with distilled or deionized water and kept dry when not in use.</p>
<h2>Protection</h2>

<p>Most sensors are sold with protective caps or bottles that meet the storage requirements and provide mechanical protection. The platinum
 wire or disk of the ORP sensor and the glass bulb on a pH sensor is very fragile, and should always be covered when not in use.</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>
<p>A sensor may become fouled, and require cleaning. Cleaning solutions
 are available and will help remove deposits of proteins or other
 materials from the glass bulb or conductive surfaces. Follow the
 manufacturer's directions for using these solutions. Cleaning will not
 help in the case where the reference cell has become contaminated. Do
 not use abrasives to clean the sensor since this can adversely affect the measurement accuracy.</p>
      
<h2>Contamination</h2>
      
<p>The reference cell of a combination sensor can become contaminated. This condition usually means that the sensor must be discarded. To
 protect against contamination, make sure that you are using an sensor
 that is appropriate for the solutions being measured. Double junction sensors have a second barrier to limit contamination and are recommended for solutions with high ion concentrations. Don't leave the sensor in
 the solution longer than required to take the measurement and rinse the sensor then store in a storage solution similar to our 
<a title="Sensorex S016 pH Sensor storage solution" href="http://smartaquameter.com/ph-orp-buffers/s016.html">S016 pH sensor storage solution</a> after each use.</p>
